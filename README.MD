# Stream TV PIP
Watch Twitch stream with a hidden sub screen on top-left side.
This page is requested by my friend, and this is done in short time so there are very less options available as of now.

## Usage
- https://fsworld009.github.io/StreamTvPIP/?sub={sub_channel_id}

Open the page with default sub stream channel `{sub_channel_id}` in options dialog

- https://fsworld009.github.io/StreamTvPIP/?main={main_channel_id}&sub={sub_channel_id}

Open the page without options dialog, load main channel and sub channel automatically
